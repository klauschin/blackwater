 * error boundary rather than degrading the single row it belongs to.
 *
 * DRAFT MODE was the broad cause, and it is now fixed at its source: the stega
 * `filter` in `sanity/lib/client.ts` opts `timezone` out of encoding entirely,
 * so no reader sees an encoded value — and `defineLive` shares that client, so

 * not on `filterDefault`'s denylist (which lists `status`), so every event in
 * draft mode carried invisible characters and `/events` hit its error boundary
 * on any dataset.
 *
 * The `stegaClean` below stays as a BACKSTOP rather than the fix. It is one
 * cheap call, and without it a future change to that filter would not crash —
 * it would quietly resolve a Los Angeles event in Taipei, which is the worse of
 * the two failures. That is also why it cleans BEFORE judging validity.
 *
 * The narrow one is a stored value that was never IANA — `GMT+8`, `Taipei`,
 * `UTC+08:00` from a hand-edit or an import. Nothing cheap tells those apart
 * from a valid alias like `Etc/GMT-8` or a bare `UTC`, both of which must keep
 * working, so validity is simply whatever `Intl` accepts.
