 * whole delay window (see the utility's comment in globals.css) and a grid is
 * unbounded — `/products/all` alone renders 24 cards, so an uncapped cadence
 * left the last product invisible for 1.38s after paint. The cap keeps the
 * stagger legible across the first row or two and bounds every later item to
 * the same ceiling the buy column uses.
 *
