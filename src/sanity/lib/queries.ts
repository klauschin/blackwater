//
// `$upcomingFrom` is a payload bound, not the answer. selectUpcomingEvents() in
// src/lib/event-date.ts decides what is actually upcoming, because that needs the
// event's own timezone and an end-of-day fallback when endDatetime is blank —
// neither expressible in GROQ. So the bound is day-granular and a day slack,
// which also sidesteps a lexicographic trap: `utc` compares as a string (as
// pEventsQuery does too) and Sanity omits zero milliseconds while
// Date#toISOString does not, so "…:00Z" > "…:00.000Z".
//
// coalesce(endDatetime, eventDatetime) keeps a multi-day event that is still

// ascending and the window is an upper bound on that same ordering, so the only

// pEventCategory tag on that page's fetch, all for nothing. It is the decoder

//
// Anchored on $slug -- the same params the page's own fetch already takes -- so
// EventRelated owns its data instead of waiting on ids projected out of
// pageEventSingleQuery. That is the composition rule: a component that needs
// nothing from its parent's fetch can never be stuck behind it. It also means
// `categoryTitle` and `locationName` for the two headings come back here rather
// than being threaded down as props.
//
// Fetched by EventRelated, NOT nested in pageEventSingleQuery, and the reason is
// tags rather than cache keys. /api/revalidate-tag fires revalidateTag(_type)
// AND revalidateTag(`${_type}:${slug}`), and the page's own read is scoped to
// `pEvent:${slug}` so publishing event B cannot expire event A's document. This
// strip MUST expire when B changes, so it needs the broad `pEvent` tag --
// nesting it would put that tag on the page's own fetch, which generateMetadata
// awaits through the same cache(), and every publish would then invalidate the
// metadata of all 178 event pages and pull 8 related rows just to read
// `sharing`.
//
// NO WALL-CLOCK PARAM, deliberately. `order(eventDatetime.utc desc)` already
// puts anything upcoming first, since a future event carries the largest
// timestamp, and then walks back through the most recent past. The clock is
// needed only to split those two halves for display, which orderByRelevance()
// does in JS -- GROQ cannot, as it needs the event's own timezone and an
// end-of-day fallback. So nothing rolls this cache key over daily.
//
// `^.^` in the series filter reaches the anchor document from inside the array
// filter's own scope (one extra level), the same shape pageProductSingleQuery's
// defaultRelatedProducts uses. Verified against both datasets.
//
// `!defined(^.categories[0]._ref)` is the fallback for the four events that
// carry no category at all (bw-94-rr, 1602-fm, 139-cr, bw-96-sc -- the field is
// unset, not an empty array, so `count(categories) == 0` does NOT find them):
// the filter degrades to "the latest events overall" rather than matching
// nothing. Three of the four have no venue either, so without this they are the
// only pages that would render no strip whatsoever.
//
// The venue arm needs `defined(^.locationRef._ref)`, or an event with no
// referenced venue matches every other event that also has none. It only ever
// finds locationRef-backed venues; an event whose venue is the one-off
// `location` string (141-cr, say) correctly gets no venue strip.
//
// The venue arm does NOT exclude category siblings in the filter, and that is
// deliberate. Doing so looks like the obvious efficiency win -- 17 of the 34
// venue-bearing events share both category and venue with their siblings, so
// rows are fetched and then dropped by EventRelated's JS dedupe. But measured,
// filtering them out in GROQ empties the venue strip on those same 17 of 34
// events: "same programme, same venue, just older" is the most relevant set
// there is, and the series arm cannot show it because those events fall outside
// its own slice. So the dedupe stays in JS, where it only removes rows the
// series strip is actually rendering.
//
// [0...6] rather than 8: every row returned becomes a rendered slide, in the
// HTML and again in the inlined RSC payload, and the carousel shows 4 at its
// widest (basis-1/4). The house default for an event strip is 5
// (DEFAULT_EVENT_LIMIT in event-date.ts).
//
// eventCardFields is interpolated at the QUERY level, exactly as
// upcomingEventsQuery does -- a sibling at the same depth, not a new level on
// the eventStatusListFields -> linkFields -> resolvedHrefGroq chain. Do NOT
// wrap either projection in a fragment; that is the level that kills the
